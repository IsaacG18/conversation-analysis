Sarah Thompson,What are you guys talking about? Is everything okay?,02/04/2023 08:15,
Alex Williams,"No, something happened last night...",02/04/2023 08:18,
Alex Williams,The police arrested Antonio and charged him with drug trafficking. I was involved too.,02/04/2023 08:19,
Emma Lee,What?! How did that happen?,02/04/2023 08:20,
Alex Williams,We were buying weed from a guy we thought we could trust. But he was actually an undercover cop.,02/04/2023 08:22,
Sarah Thompson,"Oh no, that's terrible. Have you talked to a lawyer?",02/04/2023 08:24,
Alex Williams,"Not yet, we're still trying to figure out what to do.",02/04/2023 08:25,
Emma Lee,You should definitely talk to a lawyer as soon as possible. They can help you understand your options and guide you through the legal process.,02/04/2023 08:28,
Sarah Thompson,I know a great lawyer who specializes in drug cases. I can give you their contact information if you want.,02/04/2023 08:30,
Sarah Thompson,Here: John Doe +447761123432,02/04/2023 08:31,

Emma Lee,"Let me know if you need anything else, Alex. I'm here to help.",02/04/2023 08:35,
Sarah Thompson,"Yeah, same here. We're all in this together.",02/04/2023 08:36,

Emma Lee,I can only imagine. But we'll get through it together.,02/04/2023 08:40,
Sarah Thompson,"Btw, Alex, did you guys discuss the details of the deal over the phone or in person?",02/04/2023 08:43,
Alex Williams,We talked about it over the phone and then met in person to make the exchange.,02/04/2023 08:45,
Emma Lee,Did you mention anything specific about the location of the exchange?,02/04/2023 08:47,
Alex Williams,"No, we just agreed to meet at a certain time and place.",02/04/2023 08:49,
Sarah Thompson,"That's good. If the police don't have any recorded evidence of you discussing the exchange location, it might be harder for them to prove their case.",02/04/2023 08:51,
Alex Williams,"I hope you're right, Sarah. This whole situation is a nightmare.",02/04/2023 08:54,
Emma Lee,Do you guys know if Antonio has a lawyer yet?,02/05/2023 08:40,
Alex Williams,"I'm not sure, I haven't been able to reach him yet.",02/05/2023 08:41,
Sarah Thompson,I can try calling his family and see if they know anything.,02/05/2023 08:43,
Emma Lee,That's a good idea.,02/05/2023 08:45,
Alex Williams,"Yeah, let us know if you find anything out.",02/05/2023 08:47,
Sarah Thompson,"Okay, I just spoke with his sister. She said he hasn't been able to get a lawyer yet because he can't afford one.",02/05/2023 08:49,
Emma Lee,That's terrible.,02/05/2023 08:51,
Alex Williams,Is there anything we can do to help?,02/05/2023 08:53,
Sarah Thompson,"I'm not sure, but I can look into some organizations that offer legal aid to people who can't afford it.",02/05/2023 08:55,
Emma Lee,Sounds good!,02/05/2023 08:57,
Alex Williams,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate it. I'll get in touch with them right away.",02/06/2023 08:32,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Hey guys, I've just been let out of the station. This has been a wild ride!",02/06/2023 08:34,
Alex Williams,"Yeah, it's a nightmare. We didn't know that guy was an undercover cop.",02/06/2023 08:36,
Antonio Rodriguez,I told you guys not to trust him. He's been in trouble with the law before.,02/06/2023 08:38,
Emma Lee,"Wait, what do you mean he's been in trouble with the law before?",02/06/2023 08:40,
Antonio Rodriguez,"He's a drug dealer, he got caught smuggling cocaine over the border once.",02/06/2023 08:42,
Antonio Rodriguez,I've bought drugs from him before.,02/06/2023 08:42,
Sarah Thompson,"Antonio, why didn't you tell us this before!?",02/06/2023 08:43,
Antonio Rodriguez,I didn't want to get anyone in trouble. I thought I could handle it on my own. I didn't know how tell Amy about it either.,02/06/2023 08:45,
Emma Lee,"Well, now we're all in trouble. We need to figure out how to get out of this mess.",02/06/2023 08:47,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Don't worry, I just sold my last bag. I bought the weed last Friday night from a guy named Carlos. He hangs out at the convenience store on 5th and Main.",02/06/2023 15:10,
Alex Williams,Do you remember how much you paid for them?,02/06/2023 15:15,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Yeah, I paid $200 for an ounce.",02/06/2023 15:18,
Emma Lee,"Wow, that's really expensive. How much did you sell it for?",02/06/2023 15:21,
Antonio Rodriguez,I sold it for $20 a gram. I made a pretty good profit.,02/06/2023 15:25,
Sarah Thompson,But it's not worth the risk of getting arrested and going to jail. I hope you guys learned your lesson.,02/06/2023 15:28,
Alex Williams,"Yeah, we definitely did. We won't be making that mistake again.",02/06/2023 15:31,
Emma Lee,Agreed. Let's focus on moving forward and making better choices in the future.,02/06/2023 15:33,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Hey guys, I wanted to talk to you about something. I know we got in trouble because of the weed, but I think we can make some serious money if we buy more and sell them.",02/07/2023 10:51,
Antonio Rodriguez,Just look at this… ,02/07/2023 10:52,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQNYCWoKzJlhy3iIqez6YXxoZ_RoMBEove9dA&usqp=CAU
Sarah Thompson,"Antonio, are you serious? You know what happened the last time we got involved with drugs. We're lucky we're not in jail right now.",02/07/2023 10:53,
Antonio Rodriguez,"I know, but that was because we didn't know what we were doing. This time, we can be more careful and make sure we don't get caught. Plus, I already have a buyer lined up.",02/07/2023 10:54,
Emma Lee,"Antonio, I don't think that's a good idea. We could get into even more trouble.",02/07/2023 10:56,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Come on, guys. This could be our chance to make some real money. And if we're careful, we won't get caught. I already bought some yesterday, and they're good quality. We could sell them for a huge profit.",02/07/2023 10:58,
Alex Williams,I don't know if that's such a good idea. We could get into even more trouble if we start selling drugs again.,02/07/2023 11:01,
Sarah Thompson,"I agree with Alex, we should stay away from that kind of thing.",02/07/2023 11:02,
Antonio Rodriguez,"Fine, if that's how you feel.... But I'm telling you, we're missing out on a huge opportunity here.",02/07/2023 11:05,
