2023-02-04T08:15:00,Sarah Thompson,What are you guys talking about? Is everything okay?
2023-02-04T08:18:00,Alex Williams,"No, something happened last night..."
2023-02-04T08:19:00,Alex Williams,The police arrested Antonio and charged him with drug trafficking. I was involved too.
2023-02-04T08:20:00,Emma Lee,What?! How did that happen?
2023-02-04T08:22:00,Alex Williams,We were buying weed from a guy we thought we could trust. But he was actually an undercover cop.
2023-02-04T08:24:00,Sarah Thompson,"Oh no, that's terrible. Have you talked to a lawyer?"
2023-02-04T08:25:00,Alex Williams,"Not yet, we're still trying to figure out what to do."
2023-02-04T08:28:00,Emma Lee,You should definitely talk to a lawyer as soon as possible. They can help you understand your options and guide you through the legal process.
2023-02-04T08:30:00,Sarah Thompson,I know a great lawyer who specializes in drug cases. I can give you their contact information if you want.
2023-02-04T08:31:00,Sarah Thompson,Here: John Doe +447761123432
2023-02-04T08:32:00,Alex Williams,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate it. I'll get in touch with them right away."
2023-02-04T08:35:00,Emma Lee,"Let me know if you need anything else, Alex. I'm here to help."
2023-02-04T08:36:00,Sarah Thompson,"Yeah, same here. We're all in this together."
2023-02-04T08:38:00,Alex Williams,"Thanks, guys. I really appreciate your support. This is all so overwhelming."
2023-02-04T08:40:00,Emma Lee,I can only imagine. But we'll get through it together.
2023-02-04T08:43:00,Sarah Thompson,"Btw, Alex, did you guys discuss the details of the deal over the phone or in person?"
2023-02-04T08:45:00,Alex Williams,We talked about it over the phone and then met in person to make the exchange.
2023-02-04T08:47:00,Emma Lee,Did you mention anything specific about the location of the exchange?
2023-02-04T08:49:00,Alex Williams,"No, we just agreed to meet at a certain time and place."
2023-02-04T08:51:00,Sarah Thompson,"That's good. If the police don't have any recorded evidence of you discussing the exchange location, it might be harder for them to prove their case."
2023-02-04T08:54:00,Alex Williams,"I hope you're right, Sarah. This whole situation is a nightmare."
2023-02-05T08:40:00,Emma Lee,Do you guys know if Antonio has a lawyer yet?
2023-02-05T08:41:00,Alex Williams,"I'm not sure, I haven't been able to reach him yet."
2023-02-05T08:43:00,Sarah Thompson,I can try calling his family and see if they know anything.
2023-02-05T08:45:00,Emma Lee,That's a good idea.
2023-02-05T08:47:00,Alex Williams,"Yeah, let us know if you find anything out."
2023-02-05T08:49:00,Sarah Thompson,"Okay, I just spoke with his sister. She said he hasn't been able to get a lawyer yet because he can't afford one."
2023-02-05T08:51:00,Emma Lee,That's terrible.
2023-02-05T08:53:00,Alex Williams,Is there anything we can do to help?
2023-02-05T08:55:00,Sarah Thompson,"I'm not sure, but I can look into some organizations that offer legal aid to people who can't afford it."
2023-02-05T08:57:00,Emma Lee,Sounds good!
2023-02-06T08:32:00,Alex Williams,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate it. I'll get in touch with them right away."
2023-02-06T08:34:00,Antonio Rodriguez,"Hey guys, I've just been let out of the station. This has been a wild ride!"
2023-02-06T08:36:00,Alex Williams,"Yeah, it's a nightmare. We didn't know that guy was an undercover cop."
2023-02-06T08:38:00,Antonio Rodriguez,I told you guys not to trust him. He's been in trouble with the law before.
2023-02-06T08:40:00,Emma Lee,"Wait, what do you mean he's been in trouble with the law before?"
2023-02-06T08:42:00,Antonio Rodriguez,"He's a drug dealer, he got caught smuggling cocaine over the border once."
2023-02-06T08:42:00,Antonio Rodriguez,I've bought drugs from him before.
2023-02-06T08:43:00,Sarah Thompson,"Antonio, why didn't you tell us this before!?"
