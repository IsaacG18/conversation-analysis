# Conversation analyst

To get this code running require steps for set up

# Step 1 install python and pip
You need to have Python 3.11 installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

To verify if pip is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    pip --version


# Step 2 clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/IsaacG18/conversation-analysis.git

# Step 3 set up venv

    pip install virtualenv

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'ca':


    virtualenv ca

**On Windows:**


    ca\Scripts\activate

**On macOS and Linux:**

    source ca/bin/activate


# Step 4 add .env

File path: conversation-analysis/tp3/tp3 **create a file** called **.env**

Add in the file

    CHATGPT_API_KEY=<api-key>
    CHATGPT_VERSION=<model-version>

Current version is gpt-3.5-turbo
If the key needs updated the .env and re-run Step 7

# Step 5 install packages
File path: conversation-analysis/
**Using Init Script**
You can skip Step 5 and 6 using

    chmod +x init.sh

    ./init.sh

Or for windows

    init.bat

**For manual install:**
**Window OS:**

    pip install -r win_requirements.txt

**Other OS:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt


# Step 6 run these commands
Create and run the migrations 
File path: conversation-analysis/tp3:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    
    python manage.py migrate
    
    python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb

Run the populate script

    python date_format_populate.py


# Step 7 After set up to run the website uses this command
File path: conversation-analysis/tp3

    python manage.py runserver

# To test the speed of the code run this in linux
File path: conversation-analysis/tp3
    
    time python speed_test_messages.py

To run the file 100 times do this

    time (for i in {1..100}; do python speed_test_messages.py; done)

# Get Started

**- What can you do with the website**
	- upload chat logs
	- receive analysis of the chat logs

	- get boosted from external APIs
**- Upload files**
![screenshot of upload page](image.png)
	- upload file with the 'upload' button at the right end of the navigation bar
	- adjust delimiter settings according to the format of your files
	- reorder the delimiters by input numbers. For example, if each message of you file starts from a timestamp, the order number of component 'Timestamp' should be set to 1
	- choose timestamp format used by your chat file
	- enable 'Skip First Line' if the first line of your chat log is a title
**- Customise keywords**
![screenshot of suite selection page](image-1.png)
	- messages with keywords would be highlighted in the analysis
	- keywords are grouped into suites
	- selected suites would be applied to the file analysis
	- add keywords to suites and assign risk factors
	- risk factors ranges from 0-10
	- keywords with risk factor = 0 wouldn't show up in analysis, might be useful if you want to disable some keywords temporarily
	- Person and Locations are identified by SpaCy models by default. Turn on 'Use ChatGPT for analysis' if you'd like ChatGPT to do it instead
**- File Management**
